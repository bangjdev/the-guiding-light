# the-guiding-light
A team's project participated in #weekly-game-jam-144 on itch.io with the theme "In The Dark"

This is a submission by Vedjgnab (me), TheMatttMan, and Treekanicko for Weekly Game Jam #144 made in Godot! Our first game!

This is a small puzzle-platformer where the player is exploring a dark cave and needs to bounce a light beam all the way to the end.  Use the WASD keys to move, the space bar to jump, and the mouse to aim your mirror!
All assets in the game were home-brewed, except the tilemaps, which came from Kenney's Abstract Platformer pack (https://kenney.nl/assets/abstract-platformer).
